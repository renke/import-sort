# import-sort

`import-sort` is a set of packages that allow you to sort your ES2015 (aka ES6)
imports. Both JavaScript and TypeScript files are supported.

# Sorting imports

There are multiple ways to actually sort your imports. Just pick the one that
suits you most.

## Visual Studio Code (vsc-sort-imports)

Sort your imports directy from within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

See [sort-imports](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amatiasq.sort-imports) in the Visual Studio Marketplace for more details.

This extension is originally developed by [Peter Juras](https://github.com/peterjuras) and is currently maintained by [A. Mat√≠as Quezada](https://github.com/amatiasq). Thank you both very much!

## Atom (atom-import-sort)

Sort your imports directly from within [Atom](https://atom.io/). Go to [package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-import-sort) or install it directly with `apm install atom-import-sort`. The plugin can sort imports in both JavaScript and TypeScript.

After you installed the package you can sort your imports using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> key binding or trigger it manually from the command palette with the `Import Sort: Sort` command.

The package also offers a "sort on save" option to automatically sort your imports whenever you save a JavaScript or TypeScript file. It's disabled by default.

## Vim (vim-sort-imports)

Sort your imports directy from within Vim. See [vim-sort-imports](https://github.com/ruanyl/vim-sort-imports) for more details about the configuration.

## Command Line (import-sort-cli)

Sort your imports from the command line. Useful to sort all your files in bulk or from a script in your `package.json`.

Install it with `npm install --save-dev import-sort-cli import-sort-parser-babylon import-sort-style-eslint`.


```
Usage: import-sort [OPTION] [FILE]
       import-sort [OPTION] [DIRECTORY]
       
The exit code is the number of affected files or -1 if something failed.       

Options:
  --overwrite, -o  Sort files in-place                                 [boolean]
  --write, -w      Sort and write files to specified location           [string]
  --diff, -d       Print unified diffs of changes                      [boolean]
  --status, -s     Only set the exit code                              [boolean]
  --help, -h       Show help                                           [boolean]
```

## Node.js (import-sort)

Sort your imports via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). For more information take a look at the code of the `import-sort-cli` package.

To use it you probably want to install `import-sort`, `import-sort-config`, a parser (say `import-sort-parser-babylon`) and a style (say `import-sort-style-eslint`).

The `import-sort` library is basically the heart that powers `import-sort-cli` and `atom-import-sort` and should be used if you want to integrate it with other environments.

# Dealing with comments

Prior versions of `import-sort` had problems with comments that were attached to imports. This is now mostly fixed and situations like the following should no longer cause problems.

```js
import foo from "bar" // This will move with the import
```

```js
// This will also move with the import
import foo from "bar"
```

```js
// This won't move with the import

// This will move with the import
import foo from "bar"
// This won't move with the import
```

In general, every comment that is directly above the import (no blank line between them) or is on the same line is considered part of it.

That means that things like `// eslint-disable line` and `// eslint-disable-next-line` are finally supported.

# Using a different style or parser

Styles (and parsers) can be configured on a per-project basis including support for different types of files (currently JavaScript and TypeScript).

Just add the following to your `package.json` and adapt it to your liking:

```json
"importSort": {
  ".js, .jsx, .es6, .es": {
    "parser": "babylon",
    "style": "eslint"
  },
  ".ts, .tsx": {
    "parser": "typescript",
    "style": "eslint"
  }
}
```

The keys are a list of file extensions that map to the parser and style that should be used for files that have any of the listed file extensions.

By default, `import-sort` comes with these styles:

* [`import-sort-style-eslint` (default)](packages/import-sort-style-eslint): A style that that is compatible with [ESLint's](http://eslint.org/) [sort-imports](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/sort-imports) rule.

* [`import-sort-style-module`](packages/import-sort-style-module): A style that groups and sorts by module.

* [`import-sort-style-renke`](packages/import-sort-style-renke): Renke's personal style.

# Writing you own custom style

Since styles can now be configured using your `package.json` it's way easier to write and use your own style.

A style is module that should be called `import-sort-style-$name` where `$name` is the name of the style.

An API is provided to specify how the imports are sorted (see [style API](packages/import-sort-style/src/index.ts#L3) for more details).

The best way to write your own style is to look at existing styles like [`import-sort-style-renke`](packages/import-sort-style-renke/src/index.ts) and adapt it to your liking.
