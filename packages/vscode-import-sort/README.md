# NOTE
This Extension requires at least VSC 1.7.

Note that this Plugin is a new port from the old atom-import-sort and may
contain bugs. Feel free to offer a PR.

# Preferences
## Auto Sort on Save
Auto Sort on Save defaults to TRUE. You can set it to false by providing "false" to

```typescript
{
  "importSort.sortOnSave": false
}
```

## Disable Toasts
To shut down notifications from this, set showNotifications to false.
Normally this should be disabled as this feature hasn't eveolved yet.

```typescript
{
  "importSort.showNotifications": false
}
```
